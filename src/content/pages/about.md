    title: "Quick intro"
    content: "I started my journey in tech back in 2008, fresh out of college, configuring Linux servers at the domain registry of my country (.ni). It was hands-on, challenging, and laid the foundation for a diverse career spanning a range of technical roles, from systems administration to enterprise virtualization, technical sales, frontend development, and data migrations. My hands-on experience includes building infrastructure from scratch, designing, deploying, and supporting virtualization solutions, and creating responsive web apps. After relocating to the US, I began working on data migrations for customers adopting a legal SaaS platform, streamlining their onboarding by leveraging Python scripting, SQL, and API integrations.\nMy focus now is on gradually expanding my skills in cloud platforms and DevOps practices, drawing on years of infrastructure work, programming experience, and a steady commitment to learning and automation."

        role: "Data Migration Engineer - LegalTech SaaS"
        summary: "I joined a legal management SaaS company as part of the migrations team, helping law firms transition their data from legacy systems into our platform. My role involved engaging with clients to understand their data sources, then transforming their data, whether from SQL backups or other formats, into our platform's import templates. I used tools like Python, SQL, and Excel to clean, parse, and reshape data for import. I also monitored import jobs, resolved issues, and occasionally used the API to make post-migration updates with custom scripts. Throughout the process, I kept close communication with clients over email and follow-up calls, often stepping in to answer product-related questions when needed."

        summary: "I joined a development team focused on a React-based SaaS app, contributing new features, UI fixes, and enhancements using React, Redux, Tailwind, and Vitest. I became comfortable working independently, translating Figma designs into pixel-perfect, responsive interfaces, while also supporting my fellow junior developers through pair programming and technical guidance. We used Git for version control and Azure DevOps for ticket tracking and daily standups. I also ramped up quickly on jQuery and SCSS for a separate project, delivering results under a tight timeline. This role helped solidify my frontend fundamentals and my ability to thrive in a fast-paced, collaborative environment."

        summary: "I took time off to pivot into web development, enrolling in a full-time bootcamp where I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, PHP, Laravel, and MySQL. Through hands-on projects, I built everything from responsive layouts based on Figma designs to dynamic content sites powered by public APIs, as well as foundational fullstack apps, like a to-do list and a real-time chat app, using React on the frontend and Laravel on the backend. This experience laid the foundation for my next role in tech."
